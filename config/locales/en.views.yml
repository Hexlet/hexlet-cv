        seasonality_description: "Hiring in any job field has a seasonality. The general scheme is: The hiring process begins at the end of January, it reaches its peak in March-April, than a sharp decline during the May holidays and hiring plateau in Summer.
        In September hiring increases again with its peak in October. In November the slowdown begins, which reaches its lowest point in December, when no one is hiring due to the holidays as employers are not willing to pay newcomers for 10 public holidays when they haven't done any work yet. Then the cycle repeats."
